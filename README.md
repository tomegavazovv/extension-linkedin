# Extension of dexra.co, built with React and Vanilla JS

This extension was built with the purpose of taking the LinkedIn cookies of the user, so that the functionality of dexra would be possible.
Besides the cookies, I use it extensively to communicate with the frontend, as well as the backend of the application. 

Also, the extension made it possible to migrate all the data from our competitors. 
So that the switchting cost would be 0.


I built this on my own. I used a React template for chrome extension, so hence the contributors :))
